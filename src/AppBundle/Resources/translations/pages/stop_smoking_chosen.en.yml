      info:
        1: Surprising as it may seem you are better off stopping abruptly, NOT trying to gradually cut down. Research has found that when smokers stop abruptly they are more likely to succeed.
        2: Electronic cigarettes can help you stop. Research has shown that smokers who use an e-cigarette in a quit attempt are 50% more likely to succeed.
        3: Websites and mobile apps can support you. Stop Smoking London can tell you about the best ones and help you track your progress.
